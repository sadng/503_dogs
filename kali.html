		<p>Kali is a dog who loves her space, and it's rare to see her angry.<br>When she gets annoyed, the quiet Kali we all know will turn scary and attack!<br>This only happens when she's hiding her toy or when Kanani is playing around.</p>

		<p>With very little teeth left, her tongue sticks out just about always.<br>This helps create her derpy personality everyone loves.</p>
		<br>

		<p>Sometimes, she will explore the outdoors.<br>But ultimately, home is her safe place! Most of her day is spent laying in bed.</p>

		<p>Kali and Sadie enjoying the summer sunset, taking selfies while the others play in the yard.<br>Kali has anxiety and gets easily frightened by new people and fast movements.<br>She used to avoid Sadie at all costs! Running away, yelping, and hiding.<br>Now she comes right up for pets and jumps in Sadies hands when it is time to be lifted.<br>Sadie will admit that Kali is her favorite! Maybe becuase she played hard to get.</p>
